# DashSwitcher

A PowerShell script to switch between Oculus Dash and [OculusKiller](https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller)

## Disclaimer

Please do not annoy the OculusKiller dev about this switcher! She does not support them due to her vision for the project.

## Why did I make this?

I wanted to switch between OculusKiller and the Oculus Dash since I have oculus games on my PC. However, navigating to ProgramFiles every time a huge pain and it would be easier just for a few clicks to automatically switch between OculusKiller and the stock dash.

I also wanted to make this script useable on Windows without any external dependencies. This involves using either Batch or PowerShell. I opted for the latter as it's more modern to write in.

## Instructions

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Create a shortcut from the ps1 script

3. Right-click the shortcut and open `properties`

4. Do NOT delete the autofilled path

5. In `target`, write `powershell.exe -F <path name>` where the path name is the auto-filled path for the shortcut

## Possible features

Take these with a grain of salt. I made this script on a whim.

- GUI to tell you what type of Oculus Dash is enabled

- Auto-restart Oculus services once the dash is switched
